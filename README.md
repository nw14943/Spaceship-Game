# Overview

This is a simple game demo that I used to help learn the basics of OpenGl.

The game is played using the up and down arrow keys to move the spaceship forward and backward.
When the player goes off the screen, it will warp them to the other side. There is no air
resistance, so the spaceship will continue with its current velocity until the player changes
direction with the left or right arrow keys. The player can also stop immediately with the space
bar. This will set their velocity to 0. The spaceship also has a maximum velocity.

A 10-11 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Community on a windows machine to write this code.

I used the OpenGl library with C++. This is a fairly complicated library.
